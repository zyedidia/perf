This is a fork of `acln0/perf` because the import path for that package no longer works.

`import "github.com/zyedidia/perf"`

Temporary working tree for a tentative `golang.org/x/sys/unix/linux/perf` package. See also: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24918

A variant of this package has been submitted for review at https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/sys/+/168059
